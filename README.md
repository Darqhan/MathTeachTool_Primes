MathTeachTool_Primes
====================

A short, easy tool for prime distribution, greatest common divisor, smallest common multiple.
The documentation is in English, but the main goal was to help Hungarian teachers, so it's a little bit 
can be confusing for non-Hungarian speakers. I tried to write clean everything in English as well. 

The goal of the program: 
Make a program what helps to create samples for math lessons. 
This is the first step. I have to make it portable. 

Technical info: 
Python 3.4.0 
Tkinter 8.6
